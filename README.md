# SVMtextClassifier

Welcome to the SVMtextClassifier repository!

## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to implementing text classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM). Text classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves categorizing text data into predefined classes or categories. Support Vector Machines are powerful algorithms that can be effectively utilized for this purpose.

## Contents

- **Notebooks**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that walk you through the process of text preprocessing, feature extraction, SVM model training, and evaluation.

- **Datasets**: Here, you can find example datasets used in the notebooks for practicing text classification.

- **Scripts**: This directory holds Python scripts that encapsulate the code from the notebooks, allowing for easy integration into your own projects.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SVMtextClassifier.git
   ```

2. Explore the notebooks in the `Notebooks` directory to understand the step-by-step process of text classification with SVM.

3. Check out the example datasets in the `Datasets` directory to experiment with real text data.

4. If you're looking to integrate SVM-based text classification into your own projects, you can find reusable scripts in the `Scripts` directory.
